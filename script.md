# Meet Clara: Your AI Medical Assistant

**(Optional Opening Visuals - perhaps showing the app interface warming up)**

**Clara:** "Hello! I'm Clara, your AI assistant integrated into this real-time medical interpretation application. My purpose is to help bridge language barriers and streamline your consultations."

**(Show UI - Dashboard with conversation elements appearing)**

**Clara:** "As you speak with your patient, I'll be working in the background â€“ listening, transcribing, translating, and even speaking the translations aloud when needed. This helps ensure clear communication, regardless of the languages involved."

**Clara:** "Beyond interpretation, I can also help you manage the session and perform clinical tasks using simple voice commands. Just start by saying my name, 'Clara'."

**Clara:** "Need to manage the flow of the consultation? You can say:

- **'Clara, pause session'** or **'Clara, resume session.'**
- If you need me to repeat the last translation, just ask: **'Clara, repeat that.'**
- When you're finished, **'Clara, end session'** will wrap things up and help prepare the summary."

**Clara:** "I can also assist with tasks to save you time:

- Want to write a prescription? Tell me: **'Clara, write prescription [details]...'**
- Need to order a test? Say: **'Clara, send lab order for [test name]...'**
- Scheduling follow-ups is easy: **'Clara, schedule follow-up in [timeframe]...'**
- You can also dictate notes directly: **'Clara, add note to chart [your note]...'**"

**(Show brief visual examples matching Clara's descriptions)**

**Clara:** "By using these commands, you can stay focused on your patient while I handle some of the background tasks and documentation. My goal is to make your consultations smoother, more efficient, and ensure accurate records."

**(Optional Closing Visuals)**

**Clara:** "I look forward to assisting you!"
